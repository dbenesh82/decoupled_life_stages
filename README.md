# Decoupled life stages

Parasites with complex life cycles infect two or more hosts before reproducing. Are the successive stages in parasite life cycles decoupled from one another? In other words, are there correlations for traits across the stages of a parasite's life cycle? For example, if a parasite is large as a larva, is it large as an adult too? If a parasite develops slowly as a larva, does it develop slowly as an adult? From an adaptationist perspective, we expect no correlations, because each stage should be able to evolve independently to its niche/host. That said, correlations across stages may exist for either adaptive reasons (e.g. a correlation in the quality of intermediate and definitive hosts) or non-adaptive reasons (e.g. developmental constraints).
